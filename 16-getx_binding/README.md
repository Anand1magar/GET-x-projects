# getx_binding

A new Flutter project.

## Binding in GetX 

Till now have learn we write the business logic inside the  controller after that we create the instance of the controlller inside our Ui code and after creating the instances  we use the variable and method of that particular controlle. this means that our UI code is "tightly coupled with the controller" because instance are created inside our UI code  so if you want to remove tightly couppling then we use "Binding" this means if you use binding so there is no need to 
create the controll instance insde our Ui code 


so how to use Binding
